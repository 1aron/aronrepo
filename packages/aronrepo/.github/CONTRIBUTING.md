## Developing
Split a new terminal and run `npm run dev` in the project root to watch all packages change and build:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Split a new terminal and switch to the target directory for testing to avoid running tests from other packages:
```bash
cd packages/target
```
```bash
npm run test -- --watch
```

## Testing
```bash
npm run test
```

### Contributing your test cases
Taking the [Master CSS project](https://github.com/master-co/css/tree/beta) as an example, you can freely create a file like [packages/css/tests/contributions/aron.test.ts](https://github.com/master-co/css/tree/dev/beta/packages/css/tests/contributions) for unit testing:

```ts
import { testProp, testCSS } from '../src/utils/test-css'

it('should generated with `background-color:` instead of `background:`', () => {
    testProp('bg:red', 'background-color:#d11a1e')
})

it('should contain the `:hover` selector', () => {
    testProp('fg:white:hover', '.f\\:white\\:hover:hover{color:#ffffff}')
})
```
