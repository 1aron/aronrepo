# Contributing to Aronrepo

## Developing
Split a new terminal and run `npm run dev` in the project root to watch all packages change and build:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Split a new terminal and switch to the target directory for testing to avoid running tests from other packages:
```bash
cd packages/target
```
```bash
npm run test -- --watch
```

## Building
```
npm run build
```
